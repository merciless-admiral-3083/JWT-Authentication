the purpose of Authentication is to validate only approved users to get to the website and its content
We installed npm i express jsonwebtoken dotenv
and npm i --save-dev nodemon
we added     "devStart": "nodemon server.js" ,
under scripts section in package.json
Now go to server.js
made requests.rest

we can get a secret code by typing the following in the terminal
1. Node 
2. require('crypto').randomBytes(12).toString('hex'), where 12 is the size of the code

ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET and REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET are two codes generated via the above method

if we put ### in requests.rest, it will act as ';'

made authServer.js

we have now dedicated the authServer for authentication purpose and the normal server.js for all normal words
